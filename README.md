MoodleFake
==========

A little tool for faking "commitment" to your school's moodle network. It will log into your account and "visit" all of your courses every few minutes. Time period can be changed in cron.yaml.

Setup as a cron job running on google's app engine. Make sure to switch the school's domain and insert your login information in main.py.
